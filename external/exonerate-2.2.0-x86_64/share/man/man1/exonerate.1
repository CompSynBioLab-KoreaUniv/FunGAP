.SH NAME
.\"
exonerate \- a generic tool for sequence comparison
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exonerate [ options ] <query path> <target path>
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR exonerate
is a general tool for sequence comparison.

It uses the
.B C4
dynamic programming library.
It is designed to be both general and fast.
It can produce either gapped or ungapped alignments,
according to a variety of different alignment models.
The C4 library allows sequence alignment using a reduced
space full dynamic programming implementation,
but also allows automated generation of heuristics
from the alignment models, using bounded sparse dynamic programming,
so that these alignments may also be rapidly generated.
Alignments generated using these heuristics will represent
a valid path through the alignment model,
yet (unlike the exhaustive alignments),
the results are not guaranteed to be optimal.

.RE
.SH CONVENTIONS
.T
A number of conventions (and idiosyncracies) are used within
exonerate.  An understanding of them facilitates interpretation
of the output.
.\"
.TP
.B Coordinates
An in-between coordinate system is used,
where the positions are counted between the symbols,
rather than on the symbols.
This numbering scheme starts from zero.
This numbering is shown below for the sequence "ACGT":
.\"
.SP
.nf

 A C G T
0 1 2 3 4

.SP
.fi
.\"
Hence the subsequence "CG" would have start=1,
end=3, and length=2.
.\"
This coordinate system is used internally in exonerate,
and for all the output formats produced with
the exception of the "human readable" alignment display
and the GFF output where convention and standards dictate
otherwise.
.\"
.TP
.B Reverse Complements
When an alignment is reported on the reverse complement
of a sequence, the coordinates are simply given on
the reverse complement copy of the sequence.
Hence positions on the sequences are never negative.
.\"
Generally, the forward strand is indicated by '+',
the reverse strand by '-', and an unknown or not-applicable
strand (as in the case of a protein sequence) is indicated by '.'
.\"
.TP
.B Alignment Scores
Currently, only the raw alignment scores are displayed.
This score just is the sum of transistion scores
used in the dynamic programming.
For example, in the case of a Smith-Waterman alignment,
this will be the sum of the substitution matrix scores
and the gap penalties.
.\"

.RE
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.T
Most arguments have short and long forms.  The long forms
are more likely to be stable over time, and hence should
be used in scripts which call exonerate.
.\"
.TP
.B "\-h | \--shorthelp" <boolean>
Show help.
This will display a concise summary of the available options,
defaults and values currently set.
.\"
.TP
.B "--help" <boolean>
This shows all the help options including the defaults,
the value currently set,
and the environment variable which may be used to set each parameter.
There will be an indication of which options are mandatory.
Mandatory options have no default, and must have a value supplied
for exonerate to run.  If mandatory options are used in order,
their flags may be skipped from the command line (see examples below).
Unlike this man page, the information from this option will always
be up to date with the latest version of the program.
.\"
.TP
.B "\-v | \--version" <boolean>
Display the version number.  Also displays other information
such as the build date and glib version used.
.\"

.RE
.SH SEQUENCE INPUT OPTIONS
Pairwise comparisons will be performed between all query sequences
and all target sequences.
.\"
Generally, for the best performance, shorter sequences
(eg. ESTs, shotgun reads, proteins) should be used as the
query sequences, and longer sequences (eg. genomic sequences)
should be used as the target sequences.
.TP
.B "-q | \--query " <paths>
Specify the query sequences required.  These must be in a FASTA
format file.  Single or muiltiple query sequences may be supplied.
Additionally multiple copies of the fasta file may be supplied
following a --query flag, or by using with multiple --query flags.
.TP
.B "-t | \--target" <paths>
Specify the target sequences required.  Also, must be in a FASTA
format file.  As with the query sequences, single or multiple target
sequences and files may be supplied.
.B NEW:
the target filename may by replace by a server name and port number
in the form of
.B hostname:port
when using
.B exonerate-server.
See the man page for
.B exonerate-server
for more information on running exonerate in client:server mode.

.\"
.TP
.B "-Q | \--querytype" <dna | protein>
Specify the query type to use.  If this is not supplied,
the query type is assumed to be DNA when the first sequence in
the file contains more than 85% [ACGTN] bases.
Otherwise, it is assumed to be peptide.  This option forces the
query type as some nucleotide and peptide sequences
can fall either side of this threshold.
.\"
.TP
.B "-T | \--targettype" <dna | protein>
Specify the target type to use.  The same as
.B --querytype
(above), except that it applies to the target.
.\"
Specifying the sequence type will avoid the overhead
of having to read the first sequence in the database twice
(which may be significant with chromosome-sized sequences)
.\"
.TP
.B "\--querychunkid" <id>
.TP
.B "\--querychunktotal" <total>
.TP
.B "\--targetchunkid" <id>
.TP
.B "\--targetchunktotal" <total>
These options to facilitate running exonerate on compute
farms, and avoid having to split up sequence databases
into small chunks to run on different nodes.
If, for example, you wished to split the target database
into three parts, you would run three exonerate jobs
on different nodes including the options:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
--targetchunkid 1 --targetchunktotal 3
.TP
--targetchunkid 2 --targetchunktotal 3
.TP
--targetchunkid 3 --targetchunktotal 3
.PP

NB. The granularity offered by this option only goes
down to a single sequence, so when there are more chunks
than sequences in the database, some processes will do nothing.
.RE
.\"

.TP
.B "\-V | \--verbose" <int>
Be verbose - show information about what is going on during
the analysis.  The default is 1 (little information), the higher
the number given, the more information is printed.
To silence all the default output from exonerate,
use --verbose 0 --showalignment no --showvulgar no
.\"

.SH ANALYSIS OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.B "\-E | \--exhaustive" <boolean>
Specify whether or not exhaustive alignment should be used.
By default, this is FALSE, and alignment heuristics will be used.
If it is set to TRUE, an exhaustive alignment will be calculated.
This requires quadratic time, and will be much, much slower,
but will provide the optimal result for the given model.
.\"
.TP
.B "\-B | \--bigseq" <int>
Perform alignment of large (multi-megabase) sequences.
This is very memory efficient and fast when both sequences
are chromosome-sized, but currently does not currently permit the use
of a word neighbourhood (ie. exactly matching seeds only).
.\"
.TP
.B "\--forcescan" <none | query | target>
Force the FSM to scan the query sequence rather than the target.
This option is useful, for example, if you have a single piece
of genomic sequence and you with to compare it to the whole of
dbEST.  By scanning the database, rather than the query,
the analysis will be completed much more quickly, as the overheads
of multiple query FSM construction, multiple target reading
and splice site predictions will be removed.
By default, exonerate will guess the optimal strategy based
on database sequence sizes.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--saturatethreshold" <number>
When set to zero, this option does nothing.
Otherwise, once more than this number of words
(in addition to the expected number of words by chance)
have matched a position on the query, the position
on the query will be 'numbed' (ignore further matches)
for the current pairwise comparison.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--customserver" <command>
.B NEW:
When using exonerate in client:server mode with a non-standard
server, this command allows you to send a custom command to the
server.  This command is sent by the client (exonerate)
before any other commands, and is provided as a way of passing
parameters or other commands specific to the custom server.  See the
.B exonerate-server
man page for more information on running exonerate in client:server mode.
.\"

.RE
.SH FASTA DATABASE OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\--fastasuffix" <extension>
If any of the inputs given with
.B --query
or
.B --target
are directories, then exonerate will recursively
descent these directories, reading all files
ending with this suffix as fasta format input.
.\"

.SH GAPPED ALIGNMENT OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-m | \--model" <alignment model>
Specify the alignment model to use.
The models currently supported are:
.\"
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.\"
.TP
.B ungapped
The simplest type of model, used by default.
An appropriate model with be selected automatically
for the type of input sequences provided.
.\"
.TP
.B ungapped:trans
This ungapped model includes translation of all frames of both
the query and target sequences.  This is similar to an ungapped
tblastx type search.
.\"
.TP
.B affine:global
This performs gapped global alignment, similar
to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, except with affine gaps.
Global alignment requires that both the sequences in their entirety
are included in the alignment.
.\"
.TP
.B affine:bestfit
This performs a best fit or best location alignment
of the query onto the target sequence.  The entire query sequence
will be included in the alignment, but only the best location
for its alignment on the target sequence.
.\"
.TP
.B affine:local
This is local alignment with affine gaps,
similar to the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm.
A general-purpose alignment algorithm.
As this is local alignment, any subsequence of the query
and target sequence may appear in the alignment.
.\"
.TP
.B affine:overlap
This type of alignment finds the best overlap between the
query and target.  The overlap alignment must include
the start of the query or target
and the end of the query or the target sequence,
to align sequences which overlap at the ends,
or in the mid-section of a longer sequence..
This is the type of alignment frequently used in assembly
algorithms.
.\"
.TP
.B est2genome
This model is similar to the affine:local model,
but it also includes intron modelling on the target sequence
to allow alignment of spliced to unspliced coding sequences
for both forward and reversed genes.  This is similar to the
alignment models used in programs such as EST_GENOME and sim4.
.\"
.TP
.B ner
NERs are non-equivalenced regions - large regions in both
the query and target which are not aligned.  This model can be
used for protein alignments where strongly conserved helix regions
will be aligned, but weakly conserved loop regions are not.
Similarly, this model could be used to look for co-linearly
conserved regions in comparison of genomic sequences.
.\"
.TP
.B protein2dna
This model compares a protein sequence to a DNA sequence,
incorporating all the appropriate gaps and frameshifts.
.\"
.TP
.B protein2dna:bestfit
.B NEW:
This is a bestfit version of the protein2dna model,
with which the entire protein is included in the alignment.
It is currently only available when using exhaustive alignment.
.\"
.TP
.B protein2genome
This model allows alignment of a protein sequence to genomic
DNA.   This is similar to the protein2dna model,
with the addition of modelling of introns and intron phases.
This model is simliar to those used by genewise.
.\"
.TP
.B protein2genome:bestfit
.B NEW:
This is a bestfit version of the protein2genome model,
with which the entire protein is included in the alignment.
It is currently only available when using exhaustive alignment.
.\"
.TP
.B coding2coding
This model is similar to the ungapped:trans model, except
that gaps and frameshifts are allowed.
It is similar to a gapped tblastx search.
.\"
.TP
.B coding2genome
This is similar to the est2genome model, except that the
query sequence is translated during comparison, allowing
a more sensitive comparison.
.\"
.TP
.B cdna2genome
This combines properties of the est2genome and coding2genome
models, to allow modeling of an whole cDNA where a central
coding region can be flanked by non-coding UTRs.
When the CDS start and end is known it may be specified
using the --annotation option (see below)
to permit only the correct coding region to appear in the alignemnt.
.\"
.TP
.B genome2genome
This model is similar to the coding2coding model, except
introns are modelled on both sequences.

p2d, p2d:b p2g, p2g:b, c2c, c2g cd2g and g2g
can also be used for specifying models.
.TP
.B "\-s | \--score" <threshold>
This is the overall score threshold.
Alignments will not be reported below this threshold.
For heuristic alignments, the higher this threshold,
the less time the analysis will take.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--percent" <percentage>
Report only alignments scoring at least this percentage
of the maximal score for each query.
eg. use
.B --percent 90
to report alignments with 90% of the maximal
score optainable for that query.
This option is useful not only because it reduces
the spurious matches in the output,
but because it generates query-specific thresholds (unlike
.B --score
) for a set of queries of differing lengths,
and will also speed up the search considerably.
.B NB.
with this option, it is possible to have a cDNA
match its corresponding gene exactly,
yet still score less than 100%,
due to the addition of the intron penalty scores,
hence this option must be used with caution.

.\"
.TP
.B "\-S | \--subopt" <boolean>
This option allows for the reporting of (Waterman-Eggert style)
suboptimal alignments.
(It is on by default.)
All suboptimal (ie. non-intersecting) alignments will
be reported for each pair of sequences scoring
at least the threshold provided by
.B --score.

When this option is used with exhaustive alignments,
several full quadratic time passes will be required,
so the running time will be considerably increased.
.\"
.TP
.B "\-g | \--gappedextension" <boolean>
Causes a gapped extension stage to be performed
ie. dynamic programming is applied in arbitrarily shaped
and dynamically sized regions surrounding HSP seeds.
The extension threshold is controlled by the --extensionthreshold
option.

Although sometimes slower than BSDP,
gapped extension improves sensitivity with weak,
gap-rich alignments such as during cross-species comparison.

.B NB. This option is now the default.  Set it to false
to reverse to the old BSDP type alignments.
This option may be slower than BSDP for some large scale analyses
with simple alignment models.

.SH CODE GENERATION OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-C | \--compiled" <boolean>
This option allows disabling of generated code for dynamic programming.
It is mainly used during development of exonerate.

.TP
.B "\-x | \--extensionthreshold" <score>
This is the amount by which the score will be allowed
to degrade during SDP.
This is the equivalent of the hspdropoff penalties,
except it is applied during dynamic programming, not HSP extension.
Decreasing this parameter will increase the speed of the SDP,
and increasing it will increase the sensitivity.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--singlepass " <boolean>
By default the suboptimal SDP alignments are reported by
a singlepass algorithm, but may miss some suboptimal

.B "\--joinfilter" <limit>
(experimental)

Only allow consider this number of SARs for
joining HSPs together.  The SARs with the highest potential
for appearing in a high-scoring alignment are considered.
This option useful for limiting time and memory usage
when searching unmasked data with repetitive sequences,
but should not be set too low, as valid matches may be ignored.
Something like

Indicate that the target is softmasked.
In a softmasked sequence file, instead of masking regions
by Ns or Xs they are masked by putting those regions in lower case

the more memory it is allowed to use, the faster it will go.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--forcefsm" <none | normal | compact>
Force the use of more compact finite state machines

The jump between query words used to yield the word neighbourhood.
If set to 1, every word is used, if set to 2, every other word is used,

.SH HSP CREATION OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\--hspfilter" <threshold>
Use aggressive HSP filtering to speed up heuristic searches.
The threshold specifies the number of HSPs centred about
a point in the query which will be stored.
Any lower scoring HSPs will be discarded.
.\"
This is an experimental option to handle speed problems
caused by some sequences.  A value of about 100 seems to work well.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--useworddropoff" <boolean>
When this is TRUE, the score threshold for admitting words
into the word neighbourhood is set to be the initial word score
minus the word threshold (see below).
This strategy is designed to prevent restricting the word
SSSYY**CC*WLLLLPPPPHHQQRRRRIIIMTTTTNNKKSSRRVVVVAAAADDEEGGGG
.\"
When this is FALSE, the word threshold is taken
to be an absolute value.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--seedrepeat" <count>
.B NEW:
The seedrepeat parameter sets the number of seeds which must be found
on the same diagonal or reading frame before HSP extension will occur.
Increasing the value for
.B --seedrepeat
will speed up searches,
and is usually a better option than using longer word lengths,
particularly when using the
.B exonerate-server
where increasing word lengths requires recomputing the index,
and greater increases memory requirements.
.\"
.TP
.B "\-w \--dnawordlen" <bases>
.TP
.B "\-W \--proteinwordlen" <residues>
.TP
.B "\-W \--codonnwordlen" <bases>
The word length used for DNA, protein or codon words.
When performing DNA vs protein comparisons,
a the DNA wordlength will always (automatically)
be triple the protein wordlength.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--dnahspdropoff" <score>
.TP
.B "\--proteinhspdropoff" <score>
.TP
.B "\--codonhspdropoff" <score>
The amount by which an HSP score will be allowed to degrade
during HSP extension.  Separate threshold can be set
for dna or protein comparisons.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--dnahspthreshold" <score>
.TP
.B "\--proteinhspthreshold" <score>
.TP
.B "\--codonhspthreshold" <score>
The HSP score thresholds.  An HSP must score at least this much
before it will be reported or be used in preparation of a heuristic
alignment.
.TP
.B "\--dnawordlimit " <score>
.TP
.B "\--proteinwordlimit " <score>
.TP
.B "\--codonwordlimit " <score>
The threshold for admitting DNA or protein words
into the word neighbourhood.
The behaviour of this option is altered by the
.B --useworddropoff
option (see above).

.\"
.TP
.B "\--geneseed" <threshold>
Exclude HSPs from gapped alignment computation
which cannot feature in a alignment
containing at least one HSP scoring at least this threshold.

This option provides considerable speed up
for gapped alignment computation,
but may cause some very gap-rich alignments to be missed.

It is useful when aligning similar sequences back onto genome quickly,
eg. try --geneseed 250
.\"
.TP
.B "\--geneseedrepeat" <count>
.B NEW:
The geneseedrepeat parameter is like the seedrepeat parameter,
but is only applied when looking for the geneseed hsps.
Using a larger value for
.B --geneseedrepeat
will speed up searches when the
.B --geneseed
parameter is also used.
(experimental, implementation incomplete)
.\"
.SH ALIGNMENT OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\--alignmentwidth" <width>
Width of alignment display.  The default is 80.
.\"
.TP
.B "\--forwardcoordinates" <boolean>
By default, all coordinates are reported on the forward strand.
Setting this option to false reverts to the old behaviour (pre-0.8.3)
whereby alignments on the reverse complement of a sequence are
reported using coordinates on the reverse complement.
.\"
.SH SUB-ALIGNMENT REGION OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\--quality" <percent>
This option excludes HSPs from BSDP when their components
outside of the SARs fall below this quality threshold.
.\"
.SH SPLICE SITE PREDICTION OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\--splice3" <path>
.TP
.B "\--splice5" <path>
.B NEW:
Provide a file containing a custom PSSM (position specific score matrix)
for prediction of the intron splice sites.

The file format for splice data is simple: lines beginning with \'#\'
are comments, a line containing just the word \'splice\' denotes
the position of the splice site, and the other lines
show the observed relative frequencies of the bases flanking
the splice sites in the chosen organism (in ACGT order).

.TP
.B "\--forcegtag" <boolean>
Only allow splice sites at gt....ag sites
(or ct....ac sites when the gene is reversed)
.\"
With this restriction in place, the splice site prediction
scores are still used and allow tie breaking when there
is more than one possible splice site.
.\"

.SH STRATEGIES FOR SPEED

Keep all data on local disks.

Apply the highest acceptable score thresholds
using a combination of --score, --percent and --bestn.

Repeat mask and dust the genomic (target) sequence.
(Softmask these sequences and use --softmasktarget).

Increase the --fsmmemory option to allow more query multiplexing.

Increase the value for --seedrepeat

When using an alignment model containing introns, set --geneseed
as high as possible.

If you are compiling exonerate yourself,
see the README file supplied with the source code
for details of compile-time optimisations.
